# Data Analyst Capston Projet

 I address a pertinent business challenge necessitating thorough data analysis on real-world datasets. In particular the stack Overflow Developer Survey dataset is used to perform a comprehensive data analysis. The dataset is a rich source of information, providing insights into the preferences, opinions, and demographics of software developers worldwide. 

I Perform the various tasks that include: 
- Data collection from multiple sources 
- Data wrangling and data preparation 
- Exploratory data analysis  
- Statistical analysis and data mining 
- Data visualization with different charts and plots, and 
- Interactive dashboard creation. 

The culmination of the project involves delivering a comprehensive data analysis report tailored for diverse stakeholders. This report comprises an executive summary, detailed analysis, and a conclusive overview. My evaluation encompasses not only the adeptness demonstrated throughout the Data Analysis process stages but also the excellence of the final deliverable.

Demonstrating proficiency with tools and technologies such as Jupyter Notebooks, SQL, Relational Databases (RDBMS), and Business Intelligence (BI) tools like Cognos, I leverage Python Libraries including Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Scipy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, among others, to effectively tackle the project's requirements.

## Interactive Dashboard

In this module, I create dashboards using IBM Cognos Analytics. This platform enables me to generate diverse charts while constructing visually appealing and easily understandable dashboards. My dashboards incorporate intuitive data analysis functionalities, facilitating the drill-down of data as necessary.
